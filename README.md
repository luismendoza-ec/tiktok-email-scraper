# TikTok Email Scraper

This project is a web scraper that extracts TikTok profiles that have email addresses in their bio and a minimum number of followers. The scraper searches for profiles based on a keyword or a hashtag and returns a list of profiles that match the criteria.

The scraper is implemented in JavaScript and uses the browser's built-in DOM API to navigate and extract data from the TikTok search results. The minimum number of followers required can be configured by changing the value of the ```MIN_USER_FOLLOWERS``` variable. Similarly, the maximum number of profiles to extract can be set using the ```MAX_RECORDS_TO_FIND``` variable.

To use the scraper, simply copy and paste the code into the browser console on a TikTok search results page, and hit enter. The scraper will start extracting data and printing it to the console.
